TIL:
1. in php this opperator, known as the elvis opperator:
```php
:?
```
2. is essentially a ternary opperator. In this case though, If the left side of 
the opperator is truthy, then the left side is returned, otherwise the right side 
gets returned

Setup notes:
1. Make sure that php xdebug is already installed before doing anything stupid by
running 
```bash
php -v
```
-or-
```
php -i
```
if you run php -i, then you're going to want to go to xdebug.com (or whatever the
website is) and then paste the output into the wizard (xdebug.com/wizard). The 
output from the wizard should tell you if you need to install the xdebuger.
2. live site for [ rems ](https://nexday.rocksolidinternet.com/)
