* After their 2 o'clock meeting, Karl came out and told me that I just got assigned
task RS-8193. He said that he was fighting for me to take this task on even though
people in the meeting were saying it was too hard for me right now.

* Chris W told me I did a great job on RS-8213 Update the Update Custom Rate Sheets
Tool and that my code was "beautiful code"

* Roger pulled me into his office because he wanted to talk to me about all the
hard work and many hours I've spent in the office in my first almost two months.
He told me that I am far exceeding expectations and that I'm "doing incredible."
He told me that he has noticed me putting in 12 hour days and really appreciates
it. That I fulfill his desire of having an employee with a good attitude, a hard
worker, excited everyday to come into work and someone who gets good work done.
He spoke to me for roughly 30 min at the end of the work day.

Karl told me that he's glad he hired me instead of Zachary Springer (back when
I was interviewing and later when he also interviewed)

Roger has said several times that he is excited for my progress and that he's
planning on having me take over a piece of development so that Karl can start
working on the higher priority tasks
