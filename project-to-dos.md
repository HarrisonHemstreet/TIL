# What all Projects Need:
1. Put all info not contained within codebase into the wiki, suchas:
2. Prettier config
3. css formats/rules/guidelines

## Prettier Config:
* spaces on both ends of a {} like so: `{ braket, space }`
* in React and anything javascript, require semi-colons
* for any javascript modules including react components, require the export at
the bottom of the file with an extra line at the end
* require file names and componets to be upper cammel case
* double quotes only
* tabs are 4 spaces. we use 4 spaces for everything
* component code and styles located in the same folder
* all pages/components should be jsx. everything else that is heavier in logic
should be js
