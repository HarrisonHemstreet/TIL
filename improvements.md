# Tutorial Videos
1. the tutorial videos have poorly recorded audio. I think that we could probably get better
voice acting from someone else as well.

**Possible Solutions**:
* hire someone on Fiverr to make a cool video intro AND outro for each of our videos
* hire someone to record the audio with the exact same words, OR take this as an 
opportunity to write a new script
